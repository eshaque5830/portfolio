# Projects
## 1: Predicting bank customer churn using ML
Data Exploration: Summarizing datasets and describing columns
Importing Libraries and loading datasets, exploring data.
Data Preparation: Dropping columns, handling categorical variables, and splitting data
Plotting: Visualizing data distribution and count plots
Model: Building XGBClassifier, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance
Evaluation Summary: Reporting accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for predicting bank customer churn
## 2: Project Heart Disease Prediction UCI
Performed EDA on the dataset.
Machine Learning Model: Split data, encode features, define models, iterate over models for cross-validation, evaluate, and save the best model with pickle
The minimum age to have a heart disease starts from 28 years old
Most of the people get heart disease at the age of 53-54 years
Most of the males and females get are with heart disease at the age of 54-55 years
Male percentage in the data: 78.91%
Female Percentage in the data: 21.09%
Males are 274.23% more than females in the data
## 3: PAKISTAN International Airlines - Sentiment Analysis using VADER
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a method that determines the sentiment of a piece of text, such as a sentence or paragraph. VADER is a pre-built, lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool designed for social media text
Utilize BeautifulSoup for web scraping Skytrax data on British Airways
Clean text by removing special characters and numericals
Tokenize and perform POS tagging for word context preservation
Remove stopwords and lemmatize words for root forms
Implement VADER for sentiment analysis and classification
Visualize sentiment analysis results using matplotlib
## 4: Rice Diseases Classification TensorFlow
code implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow for classifying rice diseases based on input images
A sequential CNN model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API with convolutional, max-pooling, flattening, dropout, and dense layers
The model is trained on the training dataset with early stopping to prevent overfitting
Model Used: Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow
Observations:
We have 10407, images in train data.
We have 10 unique disease classes.
We also have 10 variesites of RICE in this data.
We have rice plant age ranging from 45 - 85 days.
ADT45 is the most common variety inside the training data.
